//memory threads game in javascript

  /*  --------  memory work------
  #stack Memory -primitive - means when when we declare a variable the copy of the variable is given
  #heap memory - non-primitive - whenever a object is decleared the reference of the original values is given means if we change anything it reflects in original value
 example{
 
 let myYoutubeName = "Its mine chance"
 let anothername = MyYoutubeName

 console.log(anothername)
 anothername = "Chai aur code"


 example heap{
 
 let userOne = {
       email: "anurag@33gmail.com"
       upi : "user@ybl"     
 }

 let userTwo = userOne
    
userTwo.email = "adfd@google.com"
